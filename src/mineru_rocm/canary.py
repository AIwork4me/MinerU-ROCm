"""Materialize a canary subset from the full ground truth.

The committed canary manifest is the source of truth for the canary: it lists
the pages IN FILE ORDER and records the source-GT SHA256. This module
reconstructs the canary subset byte-identically from the full GT by selecting
pages in manifest order and re-serializing compactly — so the canary can be
regenerated without committing the (large) subset, and the result is verifiable
against the recorded SHA256.

No GPU, no model deps. Pure stdlib.

    Selects full-GT pages by ``image_path`` in the manifest's recorded order,

    the original subset), writes to ``out_path``, and verifies the SHA256 equals
    the manifest's ``source_json_sha256``. Returns the written SHA256.
